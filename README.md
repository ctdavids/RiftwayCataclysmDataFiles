## Overview ##

This is a Github repository of datafiles initial created using the [BSData template](https://github.com/BSData/TemplateDataRepo).
The data files themselves are created and maintained by a community of volunteers in no way endorsed by BattleScribe, 
NewRecruit, or any other company/publisher.

### What's Riftway Cataclysm ###

It's a free, miniature-agnostic war game. You can find more about it here: https://riftwaycataclysm.com/.

It also has an official discord: [![Riftway Cataclysm Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/558412685981777922.svg?logo=discord&style=popout-square)](https://discord.gg/XS6khzJS6c).

### How to use these files ###

The files are developed for and tested with [NewRecruit](https://newrecruit.eu/). They may work with other applications, 
but there are no guarantees.

Our recommend printing settings for your roster are:
* Use Pretty PDF print
* In the options
  * Display Roster Name and/or Note as you prefer
  * Hide Forces entirely
  * Show Cards (none of the sub options need to be enabled)
  * Show Force Rules if you want a list of all standard rules included (hide if you know them/have a cheat sheet)
  * Show Selection Rules (this will show uncommon rules, primarily those associated with your Commander)
